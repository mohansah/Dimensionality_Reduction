# Dimensionality_Reduction

Under this, I have gone through the details of dataset (MNIST) and reduction techniques ( PCA & t-SNE) and successfully minimized the 784 dimensions of MNIST dataset into 2 dimensions using the two techniques which I mentioned before . I used python programming language & jupyter Notebook software for the implementation .

# PROBLEM DEFINITION:
To implement reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE) on MNIST dataset

# Hardware Required:
1. CPU - Intel 2.4 GHz Core i5
2. System Memory â€“ Minimum 1GB RAM and 512 GB Space
3. Storage - 1 TB SATA SSD for OS + 3 TB 7200 rpm HDD for Long-term Data Storage

# Software Required:
1. Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks
2. Python programming language.
3. Libraries- numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

# DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION CAN BE DONE IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS:

1. By only keeping the most relevant variables from the original dataset (this technique is called feature selection)
2. By finding a smaller set of new variables, each being a combination of the input variables, containing basically the same information as the input variables (this technique is called dimensionality reduction)
